# MapManual

MapManual is a prototype workflow tool for manually creating geo-location data sets.

MapManual was created as part of Open Data Day 2014, and was inspired by the manual work required by the team to create their desired geographic data set.

When a data set is not available, peopl are often required to manually create the data set. This means determining the geographic coordinates and adding the attributes manually. With this tool, the process is optimized though an interface. The user is able to build the data set by selecting locations on a map and add the relevant attributes to each. The files can then be downloaded to the user's computer in the form of a CSV file.
