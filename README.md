**MapManual is a prototype workflow tool for manually creating geo-location data sets.**

## Motivation

MapManual was created as part of Open Data Day 2014, and was inspired by the manual work required by the team to create their desired geographic data set.

When a data set is not available, people are often required to manually create the data set. This means determining the geographic coordinates of each feature and adding the attributes manually into a file. With this tool, the process is optimized though a map-based workflow. The user is able to build the data set by selecting locations on a map and add the relevant attributes to each. The files can then be downloaded to the user's computer in the form of a CSV file.

## Progress

MapManual is at a stable proof-of-concept. Users can:

- Add a geo-located item to the list
- Add a description attribute to an item
- Remove single items or clear the entire list
- Download the entire list

## Moving forwards

Iterating through the prototype allowed me to test and refine the feature set and dream up new features that would bring more value to the tool. Some of these include:

- User can customize the list of attributes shown and added to each feature.
- Data is valudated to ensure each new feature has the required attributes.
- User can see added features on the map.
- User can edit existing features.
- User can upload a csv to the system and continue working on that data set.
